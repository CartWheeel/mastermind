# Overview
To advance my understanding of Erlang, I developed a command-line version of the game Mastermind. This project allowed me to explore key Erlang concepts, including concurrency, pattern matching, recursion, and error-handling capabilities that Erlang is known for. The game demonstrates how to manage real-time user interaction and dynamically update the state of the game board.

I built this Mastermind game to get hands-on practice with Erlang. The project let me dive into things like generating random numbers, pattern matching, and handling user input in a terminal. It was a great way to see how Erlang works with lists and sequences and to get familiar with the basics of process control and data handling.
